# bzm_telraam
project: Berlin z채hlt Mobilit채t

"bzm.py" in the "App" folder contains demo python code that explores the possibilities to use Dash and Plotly for a dashboard to represent trafic data for the "Berlin z채hlt Mobilit채t" initiative.

"bzm_merged_all_test_read.xlsx" in the "Data files" folder contains the traffic data that is used by the "bzm.py" program. The data comes from the original "bzm_telraam_202X_XX.csv.gz" files but have been reduced to a limited number of streets to allow for short processing times during demo development.
